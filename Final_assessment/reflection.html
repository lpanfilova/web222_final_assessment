            When creating a web site, a developer should use the responsive design approach. The idea of this 
            approach is to ensure that every web page is displayed correctly regardless of dimensions of the 
            viewport. In other words, the web page should remain clear and readable not only in a computer web 
            browser, but also on phones and tablets. This also includes readability when the browser window is 
            resized or when the screen resolution may be different, e. g. a small one like 640x480 or a large 
            one like 8k. To ensure that the approach is respected, a developer should test the website with 
            different screen resolutions and browser window sizes. It also requires proper CSS properties for 
            many HTML elements to make sure that they resize properly. The approach also allows to set separate 
            styles for different devices such that page may look quite differently on a smartphone with a 
            narrow screen and a touch control versus a computer with a wide screen and a mouse control.

            The responsive design is important for web technologies since a website can be opened on a number of devices 
            with very different screen resolutions. Additionally, the web browser may be resized on a single device, which 
            increases the number of possible resolutions where the appearance of the web page must remain correct. The 
            ability to set separate styles for different devices is vital for touch screen devices where it is hard to 
            click on a small element or read a small font. Several JavaScript events like mouseover might be not useful 
            on a smartphone with touch control. Thus, a dedicated style based on other JavaScript events may be necessary.

            I learned that HTML elements need special CSS properties determining their width, height, and other properties 
            to follow the responsive design approach. One should make HTML elements resize automatically based on the 
            viewport resolution using such properties as min-width/max-width, min-height/max-height. Additionally, we 
            can tie dimensions to viewport width and height through viewport-related measures vw/vh rather than 
            pixel-related px. Alternatively, we can use a percentage measure, which relates to the size of parent 
            container. Also, we can make elements to take up the page space evenly by using grid-related CSS property 
            grid-template-columns. Finally, we can provide a special style for a range of resolutions by using @media 
            query in CSS. In any case, it is important to test the appearance of the web page on a number of reasonable 
            viewport resolutions during the development process.

            In this course I learned the basics of web design and development with such technologies as HTML5, CSS, 
            JavaScript, as well as the best practices including the responsive design approach. We had a fair amount 
            of practice with assignments and tests where we had to develop web pages partially or from scratch. I am 
            very satisfied with the course content since I am now able to create a simple web page which enables me 
            to move forward to learning a more complex framework for web development, e. g. React, Angular. I think 
            this course has prepared me well for WEB 322 in the next semester.
